# Varnish forwarder
Transparently forwards all requests to multiple Varnish cache servers. Has an option to get the servers' IP
addresses from [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) given a cluster and service names.

# Build and run
```bash
$ go mod download
$ go build -o main .
$ FWD_PROVIDER=static FWD_BACKENDS=http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3001 ./main
```

In two other terminals launch the two example backends by running:
```bash
$ npx http-echo-server 3000
```
and
```bash
$ npx http-echo-server 3001
```

Sending requests to `http://localhost:6081/test` will result in the following output.
```bash
$ curl -v -X BAN http://localhost:6081/test
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:6081...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 6081 (#0)
> BAN /test HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:6081
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*

# Docker
There's a `Dockerfile` which can be built and run as follows:
```bash
$ docker build -t varnish-fwd -f Dockerfile .
$ docker run --rm -it -p 6081:6081 -e FWD_PROVIDER=static -e FWD_BACKENDS=http://172.17.0.1:3000,http://172.17.0.1:3001 varnish-fwd
```

| `VARNISH_SCHEME`                   | `http`  | *(for `ecs`)* Protocol to use for backends |
| `CLUSTER_NAME`                     |         | *(for `ecs`)* Name of the ECS cluster |
| `VARNISH_SERVICE_NAME`             |         | *(for `ecs`)* Name of the ECS service which has the Varnish tasks |
| `FWD_BACKENDS`                     |         | *(for `static`)* List of backend URLs separated by comma. E.g. `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001` |
| `FWD_BACKENDS_FILE`                |         | *(for `file`)* Path to the file that contains list of backend URLs separated by comma. E.g. `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001` |

Sample Environment config string for GoLand build configuration
```shell script
AWS_PROFILE=myprofile;AWS_IAM_AUTHENTICATOR_CACHE_FILE=.aws-credentials-cache;CLUSTER_NAME=staging;VARNISH_SERVICE_NAME=varnish;FWD_PROVIDER=static;FWD_BACKENDS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001;VARNISH_SCHEME=https;VARNISH_PORT=6081
```

You can launch a test HTTP echo server based on NodeJS as follows
```shell script
$ npx http-echo-server 3000
```
